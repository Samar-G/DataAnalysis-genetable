# DataAnalysis-genetable
Write a python program that performs analysis on the “gene_table.txt” dataset attached in order to:
1. Compute the total number of genes and compute the number of different gene biotypes.
2. Compute the minimum, maximum, average and median number of known isoforms.
3. Compute, for each chromosome, the number of genes it contains by plotting a bar chart. Also, print the chromosomes with the corresponding number of genes in increasing order.
4. Computes, for each chromosome, the percentage of genes located on the + strand.
5. Compute, for each biotype, the average number of transcripts associated to genes belonging to the biotype.
